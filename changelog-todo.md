# Preamble

This file is the `changelog` as well as `todo` for mycc project.

The changelog is recorded on daily basis, with summaries generated from LLM according to the actual code changes.
The todo items are kept without order. We pick the tasks with priority and finish them using mycc.
Once the task is marked done, it will stay in the list for an extra week after appearing in the changelog.

## The workflow

1. The user will add items to the `todo` section without order.
2. During development, an item will be picked up by evaluating the priority.
3. Once the item is done, mark it as done, togethe with a date on finish.
4. The changelog is updated on demand. Once update, todo items order than one week will be removed.

## How to update the changelog

When updating the changelog, use the following procedure:

1. **Create a checkpoint** using `checkpoint` tool to focus on the task.
2. **Get git commits** for the target date range using `git log --since="YYYY-MM-DD" --until="YYYY-MM-DD" --pretty=format:"%h %ad %s" --date=short`.
3. **Group commits by date** and summarize each day's changes into meaningful categories (e.g., "New Tools", "Fixes", "Refactoring", "Documentation").
4. **Write category-style summaries** similar to the existing format (e.g., "- **feature name**: description").
5. **Update the changelog file** by adding new date sections or appending to existing ones.
6. **Clean up todo items** that appear in the changelog and are older than one week.
7. **Call recap tool** to close the checkpoint and compress context.
